# despin-video

Inspired by the very cool, but very dizzying, video from [SpinLaunch Flight Test #8 â€“ With Camera Onboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEVD9k2GLXk), this is a POC of de-spinning videos.

## Brief description

1) Takes a video file and a range of frames.
2) Foreach frame, compute SIFT keypoints+descriptors.
    * discard those that fall inside an optional mask
3) Compute a euclidean transform between frame pairs
    * Method 1: transform between consecutive frames
    * Method 2: transform between the first frame and the current frame
4) Transform each frame with the cumulative transform (if Method 1) and write video

## Requires
* ffmpeg

## Warnings
Frames, features, and transforms are cached but not keyed against parameters like scale for example.

## Usage

```
# whatever virtualenv you like
pip install -r requirements.txt
python despin.py flight-test.mkv  --start-frame 820 --end-frame 1221 --mask flight-mask.png
# output files in /tmp
```

## Output

From the above linked video for frames 820 - 1221

Computed rotation and translation between frames. Accumulated on the right

Red pixels are keypoints not matched, green pixels are keypoints matched.

## Questions/Comments

* Do any of the video editors currently support this?
* Is there a better numerical way to accumulate the transforms to avoid roundoff?

## Future

* A hybrid method which would use the earliest+best match frame to transform against so that there is good stability and drift correction.
